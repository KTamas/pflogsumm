Pflogsumm README

There's not much to installing pflogsumm, so it's all manual.

    1. Unpack the distribution (if you're reading this, you've already
       gotten that far)

    2. Copy or move pflogsumm.pl to some directory from which you'll
       want to execute it.  Maybe rename it to just "pflogsumm."
       Watch the ownerships and permissions.  Make sure it's executable.

       E.g.:

	    cp pflogsumm.pl /usr/local/bin/pflogsumm
	    chown bin:bin /usr/local/bin/pflogsumm
	    chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/pflogsumm

    3. If there's a manual page available (pflogsumm.1), copy that to
       /usr/local/man/man1 or wherever you stash local manpages.  Make
       sure it's world-readable.

       E.g.:

	    cp pflogsumm.1 /usr/local/man/man1/pflogsumm.1
	    chown bin:bin /usr/local/man/man1/pflogsumm.1
	    chmod 644 /usr/local/man/man1/pflogsumm.1

    4. Read the man page (or the top of pflogsumm itself) for usage.

    5. Check the FAQ (pflogsumm-faq.txt)

    6. Configure your cron jobs if you're going to run pflogsumm on an
       automatic, scheduled basis.  There are tips in the manpage and
       the FAQ.

That's about it.

As the manpage and FAQ both note: pflogsumm requires the Date::Calc
Perl module if you want to use --smtpd_stats.
